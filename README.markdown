Textmate 960gs Bundle
=====================

This is a pretty simple bundle that lets you create websites using 960gs in a snap. The goal is to minimize the time you spend writing grid-specific code and maximize the time you spend creating awesome websites and experiences using 960gs. 

Installing
----------

<pre>
cd Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/
git clone git://github.com/fredoliveira/textmate-960gs.git 960gs.tmbundle
</pre>

You may need to reload your bundles on Textmate for the change to take effect. Or just restart the application.

Snippet examples
----------------

The bundle includes a few snippets that get you started with using 960gs to write grid-based pages. Lets say you want to include a 12-column container. You can do it by simply writing:

<pre>
c12 (press tab)
</pre>

Which expands to:

<pre>
<div class="container_12" id="name">
		
</div>
</pre>
